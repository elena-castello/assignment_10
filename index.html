<h1>Practice with JavaScript and Images</h1>
<h2> By: Elena Castello</h2>
<h3><em>All images by me unless otherwise noted. On this page, I learned to use JS to adapt a photo slideshow and then make it responsive for the web, adapting and adjusting different things.</em></h3>

<p>Leo Flores is a year-and-a-half-old baby I have taken care of since he was 3 months old. I would watch him every week while his mom went to Law classes here at UF. I would entertain him, play games (especially Ping Pong), feed him and allow him to delight my other friends. Leo is the best. He's always smiling and loves to meet new people. He changed every week, too. First, he couldn't even hold his head up. But now, he walks, runs, has teeth and eats real food, says "no," and gives high-fives.</p>

	<p> Special thanks to <a href = "http://roycemonty.format.com/" target="blank">Royce Abela</a> for the photo of Leo taking his first steps - while wearing my Gators vest!</p>
	<p> This photo slideshow is inspired by Professor McAdams' <a href = "https://github.com/macloo/jquery_exercises/tree/gh-pages" target="blank">GitHub Files</a> which are fantastic to start learning JS, CSS and HTML.</p>
	<p>Here you can find the link to my <a href ""target="blank"><GitHub repo></a>, where the HTML, CSS and JS files can be found.</p>
